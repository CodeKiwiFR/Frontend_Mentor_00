# Frontend_Mentor_00
First challenge: HTML, CSS and a few JS lines.

This is a front-end project based on [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw) challenge.<br>
There is only one thing to fix: when width is greater than 1440px the header and footer contents are not aligned with the main section.
